    "In summary, in this notebook I answer the 5 questions asked in Part 1, design and train a densly connected Neural Network in part 2 (also a poorly-working Gradient Boosted Trees model for comparison...), and finally explain how I gathered the necessary information from outside sources to actually generate predictions for attendance during the 2019-2020 season. Notably, I used some advanced player analytics (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/) from on Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, who were two major pickups for the Clippers during this exercise's offseason, to try and account for their impacts on team performance my attendance predictions. __Predictions for the attendance of the first 32 LAC home games (after which the NBA was suspended due to Covid-19) are shown at the end of the notebook.__\n",

    "### Develop a model to predict the at regular season games attendance\n",
    "\n",
    "As you are aware, most of the work here is in attaining and/or prepping the data. Once we have coded and cleaned our data, we will select a reasonable training/test split (perhaps a validation split too, but we are not working with a large amount of data) and be able to begin training the various models. We will then select the best performing model and see how well it can predict the per-game attendance, which will be our target variable. Another event to note when using this model to predict future seasons is the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBA had \"the Bubble\" and all sorts of wonkiness amidst the pandemic, so we would need to further examine how predictive some aspects of the historical data has remained.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Feature Selection\n",
    "Perhaps the most exciting part about data science, for me, is being able to critically think about what variables are going to be the most predictive for a desired outcome. As data scientists, we get to hone our insights and select features that we believe will make our model work. We will use a densly connected Neural Network (NN). Some thought was put into potentially using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), though since we are predicting the entirety of next season before the season begins I opted against it. I believe the RNN would be more suited to predict games in the near future given any ongoing conditions within a season. We will also test a Gradient Boosted Tree model, though I expect it to be unable to perform well given the limited training data. While I'm confident that the NN will outperform the Decision Tree model, even recent publications seem to have positive findings using Decision Trees in similar tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test a wide range of data to see what is predictive. While I certainly do not believe that selecting poor features is a good practice, I am generally a fan of casting a wide net, especially when using Neural Networks, as many of the weights of non-predictive features will approach zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our selected features are as follows:\n",
    "- Date Information: \n",
    "    - Game Number, Month, Day of week, Date (day in 'dd' form), Start Time\n",
    "- Game Information: \n",
    "    - Last Result (last game), Lagged Result (two games ago), Overtime (last game), Overtime (two games ago), Last Clippers Score (last game), Lagged Clippers Score (two games ago), Last Opponent Score (last game), Lagged Opponent Score (two games ago)\n",
    "- Season Information*: \n",
    "    - Total Wins, Total Losses\n",
    "- Opponent Information: \n",
    "    - Opponent Name, Opponent in Playoffs Last Year, Championships, Vegas Odds\n",
    "- Pricing*: \n",
    "    - Average ticket price\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*W/L totals will be from the end of last game since we cannot see into the future), Streak indicator ('W' or 'L'), Streak (integer\n",

    "Below we are calculating the average ticket price per game and sorting it by date so that we can easily incorporate it into our data later\n",
    "(NOTE: after doing some feature selection analysis, this feature was dropped (commented-out in future cells), however I am leaving the code here for reference and perhaps future use). We believe that the ticket price was likely highly colinear with other variables, such as opponents, date, and time. Since we have easier access to non-pricing information, we opted to remove the price information and keep it's co-linear counterparts for purposes of better prediction for future events (see end of notebook). With access to much more training data and LAC proprietary information, I may opt to do the inverse and keep average ticket price as a feature."

    "Our training went as well as I'd hope given the limited training data. In the graphs of the training history, we can see that both the MAE and loss begin decrease. The divergence occuring toward the last epochs may be signs of overfitting, but we seem to have stopped the training in time.  We're able to get good predictions out of it (__see end of notebook for predictions on the 2019-2020 season__), but there is reason to think it could still improve. Our biggest bottleneck was, and nearly always is, a limited amount of data. Without consistent ways to artifically augment our data (see my CNN work on my GitHub!), we were left with little more than 41 game's worth of information from a single season. While I tried to make up for this by deriving additional features, it was still a limitation. Training on more data (not necessarily more features) and some more advanced feature selection would be reasonable first steps in creating a better model."

    "The Decision Trees Model performed pretty poorly. The Model Score indicates that the model can account for roughly 1.3% of the variance in attendance. Furthermore, the model scores wildly differently after different training sessions, so this score is rather meaningless. This is not useful in a professional setting, though having additional data would again be the next step in creating a better model. We are more accurate than simply guessing the mean attendance, however. \n",
    "\n",
    "I primarily wanted to try a Decision Tree model because they are unique in that they are much more interpretable than other models. As a Data Scientist, I often tend to favor \"whatever works\" to create the most predictive model possible, however in a business setting having more interpretable results are both intellectually stimulating and directly applicable to more tangibly define how we may change organizational practices/behavior. Having more data to train a decision tree could again help with feature selection and be of interest to those in Business Intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Neural Network seems like a much more promising avenue, and I would imagine that the LA Clippers employ a range of trained models using strategies such as Recurrent Neural Networks. I would be very interested to see the architecture of such models, and how my model would do with access to more proprietary data."

    "- Game Number, Opponent, Date/Time information was taken from the LA Clippers Website, ESPN, and Google\n",
    "- Playoffs Last Year was coded by looking at whether each opponent made the playoffs in the 2018-2019 season according to ESPN\n",
    "- Championship odds were taken from Basketball-Reference.com's 2019-20 NBA Preseason Odds\n",
    "- Championship win totals were taken from the LAC provided information but adjusted for Toronto's win in 2019\n",
    "- Result/Overtime/Streak used average values of encodings from last year's data\n",
    "- All Wins, Losses and Opponent Scores (and their lagged variants) were filled using adjusted averages from the 2018-2019 season:\n",
    "    - **We adjusted the averages based on the historical productivity of new Signees Kawhi Leonard's and Paul George's last season's stats (using FiveThirtyEight's offensive/defensive RAPTOR player ratings).** We multiplied each of their offensive and defensive outputs by 0.3 and adjusted average point totals. This is not empirical, but is trying to estimate their contribution as 40% of the starting lineup.\n",
    "- We encoded the categories using the same conventions as the training data\n",
